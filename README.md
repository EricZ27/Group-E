Project Question:

Desccription of Project: We are testing desynchronizing inhibitory neuron firing as a treatment for epilepsy.

Questions or Thoughts we have:

Intro
GABA/Glutamate/Ach Models for Epileptic activity
Basic normal vs epileptic neuron single cell graph
The Gaba plot could be used to explain why treatments for epilepsy today are more focused on increasing GABA levels
Model how over time epilepsy â†’ more epilepsy 
Results
Model of why synchronized firing of Inhibitory neurons may be disadvantageous
Our proposed model of desynchronizing neuron firing

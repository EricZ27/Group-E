Group E Project

## Project Question:
Does the synchronized firing of inhibitory neurons actually increase the likelihood of epileptic seizures? 
Could desynchronizing neuron firing potentially decrease the change of future seizures?

## Background:
Compare normal to epilepsy firing patterns of a single cell
Explain excitatory/inhibitory neural networks
Causes of seizures (in terms of neural circuits, excitation/inhibition neurotransmitters) 

## Models/Links:
[possible model - nest](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=42020#tabs-1)

## Questions or Thoughts we have:
=======
Desccription of Project: We are testing desynchronizing inhibitory neuron firing as a treatment for epilepsy.

## Goals of the Research Project


Intro
GABA/Glutamate/Ach Models for Epileptic activity
Basic normal vs epileptic neuron single cell graph
The Gaba plot could be used to explain why treatments for epilepsy today are more focused on increasing GABA levels
Model how over time epilepsy â†’ more epilepsy 
Results
Model of why synchronized firing of Inhibitory neurons may be disadvantageous
Our proposed model of desynchronizing neuron firing

Group E Project

## Project Question:
Does the synchronized firing of inhibitory neurons actually increase the likelihood of epileptic seizures? 
Could desynchronizing neuron firing potentially decrease the change of future seizures?

## Background:
Compare normal to epilepsy firing patterns of a single cell
Explain excitatory/inhibitory neural networks
Causes of seizures (in terms of neural circuits, excitation/inhibition neurotransmitters)
